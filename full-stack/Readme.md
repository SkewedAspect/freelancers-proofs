# Full Stack Test

The goals of this proof are as follows:

- [ ]  Build an electron app that uses:
	- [ ] ES6 (classes, arrow functions, modules) on the server side
	- [ ] ES6 (classes, arrow functions, modules) on the client side
	- [ ] Riot.js as a client side framework
- [ ] Loads a Babylon JS scene in a window
- [ ] Performs a login with the Precursors server
- [ ] Allow chatting with the Precursors server

If we hit all of these, then we should have a good idea of how to structure and build the main application.
